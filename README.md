🧍‍♀️ CS Girlies AI Video Learning App 👩🏻‍🏫

Welcome to the CS Girlies AI-Powered Video Learning App!
This project is built by the [Computer Science Girlies community](https://www.csgirlies.com) — an open, supportive space where women in CS learn, build, and grow together.

Our mission is to create a collaborative, beginner-friendly, open-source project where contributors can learn real-world skills by shipping real code. Think of this as our community’s take on [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google): an AI-powered tool to help people learn more effectively through video, audio, and text.

When it’s good enough, we’ll host it as a public-facing web app that anyone can use — and contributors will be listed on the site and will be able to proudly say, “I helped build this.”
